# Graphical portfolio
This is my graphical portfolio that includes some of my best art and a bit of information about myself.
I am a 20-year-old student at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences. I've studied art before in high school and comprehensive school, also by myself. I've specialised in traditional art and digital 2D art as well as character design, in which I have about 10 years of serious experience.
